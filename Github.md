GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing developers with tools for version control and collaboration. It combines Git, a powerful version control system, with features that facilitate collaboration and project management. GitHub is designed for collaborative work, allowing multiple people to contribute to a project, review code, discuss issues, and merge changes efficiently.
